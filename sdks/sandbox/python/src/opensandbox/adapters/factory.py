Service factory for creating adapter instances.

Factory for creating service adapter instances that provide access to
sandbox operations including command execution, file system management,
health monitoring, and metrics collection.

All HTTP clients created by adapters share the same `ConnectionConfig.transport`
to ensure consistent pooling/proxy/retry behavior across services.
